# Game of Life

Welcome to the Game of Life repository! Explore the fascinating world of cellular automata and emergent behavior.

## Description

The Game of Life, invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970, is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of life-like patterns on a grid. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game evolves according to simple rules based on the number of neighboring alive cells.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Visual Appeal and Artistic Representation

The Game of Life produces a wide variety of visually intriguing patterns, ranging from simple oscillators and spaceships to complex structures like gliders and glider guns. Artists and mathematicians have been fascinated by the emergent behavior of the game, using it as inspiration for various forms of artistic expression, including digital art and sculptures.

## Applications

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Game of Life has practical applications in various fields, including computer science, biology, and artificial intelligence. It serves as a model for studying complex systems, pattern formation, and emergent behavior.
